                    innerText is a JavaScript property that you can use to change or read the text content inside an HTML element. It works the same way as innerHTML, but innerText only works with text content.

                    
                    Textcontent:
                    textContent is a JavaScript property that reads or sets the text content of an HTML element, just like innerText. However, there are some differences between textContent and innerText.

                <hr class="my-3">
                <p class="mt-3">Event delegation in the DOM is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element, rather than adding individual event listeners to each of its child elements. This approach leverages the concept of event bubbling.



                    Event Bubbling:
                    
                    When an event occurs on an element, it "bubbles up" through the DOM tree, triggering event listeners on its parent elements.
                    
                    
                    
                    How Delegation Works:
                    
                    Instead of assigning a listener to every child, you assign one listener to the parent. When an event happens on a child, it bubbles up to the parent. The parent's listener then checks the event.target property to determine which child element originated the event.
                    
                    
                    
                    Benefits:
                    
                    Performance: Reduces the number of event listeners, improving performance, especially with many child elements.
                    
                    
                    
                    Dynamic Elements: Handles events on dynamically added child elements without needing to add new listeners.
                    
                    
                    Simplified Code: Makes event handling code cleaner and more maintainable.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Event bubbling in the DOM is a process where an event first occurs in a child element, then reaches the parent element, and so on. Through this the parent elements can also handle that event. </p>
